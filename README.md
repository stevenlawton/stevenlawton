# 👋 Hey, I'm Steve

**Full-stack dev. Horse rider. Scout leader. Maker of things that beep, click, and occasionally catch fire (on purpose).**  
20+ years in code—real-time payments, Minecraft dashboards, weird solo tools.

By day: wrangling Go microservices, Kubernetes, API automation, and CI/CD.  
By night: soldering ESP32s, dodging Nerf darts, or debugging a heater relay while tweaking a Minecraft plugin.

> Prefer logs to dashboards. Prefer doing to meeting. Prefer fixing it now over scheduling a meeting.
