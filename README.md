# 👋 Hey, I'm Steve

Full-stack dev. Horse rider. Scout leader. Maker of things that beep, click, and occasionally catch fire (on purpose). I’ve been writing code for 20+ years – building everything from real-time payment systems to Minecraft dashboards and weird little tools that only I will ever use.

By day I’m in the guts of Go microservices, Kubernetes clusters, API automation, and whatever CI/CD system I’m currently arguing with. By night I’m soldering ESP32s, dodging Nerf darts from my kids, or trying to fix a heater relay while debugging a Minecraft plugin.
