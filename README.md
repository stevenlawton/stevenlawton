# 👋 Hey, I'm Steve
Full-stack dev. Horse rider. Scout leader. Maker of things that beep, click, and occasionally catch fire (on purpose). 
I’ve been writing code for over 20 years – building everything from real-time payment systems to Minecraft dashboards 
and quirky little tools that I will likely never use again.

By day, I’m in the guts of Go microservices, Kubernetes clusters, API automation, and whatever CI/CD system I’m currently 
arguing with. By night, I’m soldering ESP32s, dodging Nerf darts from my kids, or trying to fix a heater relay while 
debugging a Minecraft plugin.
