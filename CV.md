# Steven Lawton – CV / Resume

## Summary

I’m a seasoned Software Developer with a strong technical background across backend systems, infrastructure, and 
full-stack product delivery. I’ve worked in domains including fintech, retail, Web3, and publishing — building 
everything from real-time payment systems and internal developer platforms to API onboarding workflows and machine 
learning pipelines for historical manuscript classification.

Recently, I’ve focused on GoLang microservices, Kubernetes-based deployments, and improving developer experience through 
tooling and automation. I regularly contribute to open-source projects and maintain a suite of personal systems that I 
evolve as my tech stack grows — often rewriting and optimising them to meet new performance or infrastructure goals.

Comfortable pair programming, working independently, or leading delivery, I adapt quickly to new contexts and 
requirements. I bring technical depth, strong execution, and a pragmatic mindset to any team. Outside of work, I 
volunteer as a Beaver Scout Leader, helping young people build confidence, life skills, and a sense of adventure.
