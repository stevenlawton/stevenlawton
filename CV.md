# Steven Lawton - CV / Resume
## Summary

I'm a senior software engineer with over 20 years' experience building reliable, scalable systems across fintech, retail, publishing, and Web3. I specialise in backend and platform work, GoLang microservices, modernising legacy systems, and delivering cloud-native infrastructure that works in production.

I've worked across regulated environments. I've delivered in high-trust teams and contributed open-source and internal tooling. My technical background spans hardware and software, and my project work includes:

 - **Developer experience** - CI/CD automation, platform migration, and observability-first design.
 - **Infrastructure** - migrating legacy systems to scalable, containerised microservices.
 - **Cloud-native engineering** – developing microservices deployed to AWS/GCP, Kubernetes, and PaaS platforms.
 - **Regulatory and compliance** – systems aligned with PCII DSS, GDPR, PSD2, and internal audit frameworks.
 - **Event-driven** – RabbitMQ, Kafka, and event-driven systems built for scale and resilience.
 - **Payments** – internal and customer-facing flows across fintech, retail, and embedded environments.
 - **API design** – OpenAPI/AsyncAPI publishing pipelines, mocking, validation, and spec-first development.
 - **Internal tools and automation** – building tools that unblock teams and reduce manual effort.

I enjoy solving problems. I've learned to balance speed with rigour and pragmatism with long-term thinking. I write code that works, is easy to maintain, and self-documents. Sound engineering is as much about people as it is about the code.

I have worked on critical projects where autonomy, clarity, and delivery are crucial. I'm equally comfortable building new systems, refactoring old ones, or mentoring developers. Outside of work, I volunteer as a  Scout Leader, which mainly involves mud, camping, and helping kids figure things out the hard way. I'm also heavily involved in jousting in the UK and practice classical dressage.
