# Steven Lawton – CV / Resume

## Summary

I’m a senior software engineer with over 20 years’ experience building reliable, scalable systems across fintech, retail,
publishing, and Web3. I specialise in backend and platform work — GoLang microservices, cloud-native infrastructure, and 
developer tooling that makes life easier.

I’ve migrated legacy platforms, delivered production-grade services under pressure, and led delivery in high-trust teams.
I work fast, debug hard problems, and keep things clean, observable, and maintainable.

Equally happy writing code, shaping architecture, or mentoring devs — and I’ve got a solid track record of shipping the 
right thing without fuss.



## Personal Statement

I’m a hands-on builder with a track record of making complex systems simpler, faster, and easier to maintain. I thrive 
in roles that blend technical depth with autonomy — whether scaling backend infrastructure, improving developer 
experience, or shipping internal tools that quietly save teams hours a week.

I'm curious by nature and happiest when solving real problems for real users. Over the years, I've learned to balance 
speed with rigour, and pragmatism with long-term thinking. I write code that works, explains itself, and plays well with 
others — because good engineering is as much about people as it is about machines.


## Experience Overview

Over 20 years of professional software development, across roles ranging from hands-on contributor to team lead, and
industries including fintech, retail, Web3, and publishing. I’ve delivered backend systems, cloud-native infrastructure,
and cross-platform tools in both startup and enterprise environments.

- **Communication & Collaboration**  
  Skilled at working with engineers, product teams, business stakeholders, and leadership. Equally comfortable pair
  programming, mentoring junior developers, or leading cross-functional delivery efforts. Proven in fully remote,
  hybrid, and co-located teams.

- **Problem-Solving & Adaptability**  
  Experienced in debugging legacy systems, designing clean architectures, and migrating codebases under time or
  regulatory pressure. Able to operate under uncertainty, pick up unfamiliar tech quickly, and make pragmatic trade-offs
  to get things delivered.

- **Delivery & Technical Ownership**  
  Regularly lead the technical side of migrations, refactors, and infrastructure overhauls. Known for delivering
  maintainable, observable systems with clear boundaries and reusable patterns.

- **Volunteering & Community**  
  Longstanding **Beaver Scout Leader**, helping young people build resilience, teamwork, and life skills. This work
  reflects my broader strengths in leadership, empathy, and building environments where others can thrive.

## Skills

### Cloud-Native Backend Engineering

- **GoLang**, Java (Spring Boot), Node.js (TypeScript), Scala – used to build scalable microservices and API platforms
  in domains such as fintech, retail, and e-commerce.
- Deployed services to **AWS** (ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, IAM) and **Kubernetes** (EKS), managed via **Terraform** and *
  *Helm**.
- Designed and implemented secure identity flows using **OAuth2**, **OIDC**, and tools like **Auth0** and **Keycloak**.

### DevOps, CI/CD & Platform Tooling

- Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, and internal PaaS systems.
- Containerised and orchestrated workloads using **Docker**, **Nomad**, and **Helm**, including service mesh
  integration (**Istio**) and API gateways (**Kong**).
- Applied secrets management, environment segregation, and delivery automation across dev, staging, and production
  environments.

### API Design, Messaging & Eventing

- Designed and governed APIs using **OpenAPI**, **AsyncAPI**, and best practices for versioning, compatibility, and
  mocking.
- Built event-driven architectures with **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, and cloud-native ingestion pipelines.
- Focused on resilience, structured logging, distributed tracing, and performance tuning in production systems.

### Databases & Observability

- Worked with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB**, **Redis**, **InfluxDB**, and **TimescaleDB** across
  various use cases.
- Set up observability stacks using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Datadog**, and **Kibana**, with custom metrics and
  alerting.

### Web3 & Cryptographic Systems

- Developed and audited smart contracts in **Solidity** (Ethereum), implemented **Lightning Network** integrations, and
  contributed to open-source decentralised platforms.
- Familiar with crypto wallet infrastructure, decentralised identity flows, and ISO 20022-style messaging for regulated
  systems.

### Testing, Quality & Reliability

- Practised **TDD** and **Pair Programming** in production teams, with testing suites built using **JUnit**, **TestNG**,
  **Mockito**, and API tools like **Postman**.
- Delivered regression, integration, and performance test coverage within CI/CD pipelines.

### Developer Experience & Tooling

- Built internal tooling for developer onboarding, spec validation, and workflow automation using **GitHub Actions**, *
  *SwaggerHub**, and platform-native SDKs.
- Fluent with **IntelliJ**, **VS Code**, **Vim**, **Makefiles**, and Linux-based dev environments.
- Advocated for clean DevEx and DX automation in high-velocity teams.

### Communication, Leadership & Delivery

- Led delivery of critical migrations, refactors, and platform rebuilds, often in lean or embedded teams.
- Skilled in technical planning, mentoring, and stakeholder communication across engineering, product, and ops.
- Volunteer **Beaver Scout Leader**, with strong people skills, group leadership experience, and commitment to inclusive
  teamwork.

---

**Transferability**:  
Experience gained in fintech, retail, and e-commerce is highly transferable to SaaS, infrastructure, Web3, public
sector, and regulated industries. Comfortable working across domains where performance, security, and team agility are
key.

## Why Me?

I’m the person teams turn to when something’s complex, messy, or stuck. Whether refactoring a legacy system, standing up
a new platform, or building internal tooling, I focus on leaving systems clearer, teams faster, and outcomes stronger.
Trusted to work independently or lead delivery when it matters, I’ve built a career on pragmatism, depth, and getting
things shipped.
Readers often conclude I’m a strong fit for platform-oriented, backend-heavy roles where autonomy, clarity, and
consistent delivery matter.
