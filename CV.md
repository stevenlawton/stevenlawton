# Steven Lawton – CV / Resume

## Summary

I’m a seasoned Software Developer with a broad technical background spanning backend systems, infrastructure, and 
full-stack development. With experience across sectors including retail, fintech, Web3, and publishing, I’ve built 
everything from real-time payment systems and API onboarding platforms to machine learning pipelines for image 
recognition on medieval manuscripts.

My recent focus has been on GoLang microservices, Kubernetes deployments, and developer experience tooling — often 
working in high-autonomy roles where delivery and pragmatic problem-solving are key. I’ve contributed to open-source 
projects and frequently refactor or rebuild my own long-running personal tools as my skillset evolves.

Equally comfortable pair programming or leading delivery, I bring a mix of technical depth, delivery focus, and a long 
history of adapting to whatever a team or system needs. Outside of work, I volunteer as a Beaver Scout Leader, helping 
young people build life skills through adventure and teamwork.

- Applied secrets management, environment segregation, and delivery automation across dev, staging, and production environments.

### API Design, Messaging & Eventing
- Designed and governed APIs using **OpenAPI**, **AsyncAPI**, and best practices for versioning, compatibility, and mocking.
- Built event-driven architectures with **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, and cloud-native ingestion pipelines.
- Focused on resilience, structured logging, distributed tracing, and performance tuning in production systems.

### Databases & Observability
- Worked with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB**, **Redis**, **InfluxDB**, and **TimescaleDB** across various use cases.
- Set up observability stacks using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Datadog**, and **Kibana**, with custom metrics and alerting.

### Web3 & Cryptographic Systems

### Testing, Quality & Reliability
- Practised **TDD** and **Pair Programming** in production teams, with testing suites built using **JUnit**, **TestNG**, **Mockito**, and API tools like **Postman**.
- Delivered regression, integration, and performance test coverage within CI/CD pipelines.

### Developer Experience & Tooling
- Built internal tooling for developer onboarding, spec validation, and workflow automation using **GitHub Actions**, **SwaggerHub**, and platform-native SDKs.
- Fluent with **IntelliJ**, **VS Code**, **Vim**, **Makefiles**, and Linux-based dev environments.
- Advocated for clean DevEx and DX automation in high-velocity teams.

### Communication, Leadership & Delivery
- Led delivery of critical migrations, refactors, and platform rebuilds, often in lean or embedded teams.
- Skilled in technical planning, mentoring, and stakeholder communication across engineering, product, and ops.
- Volunteer **Beaver Scout Leader**, with strong people skills, group leadership experience, and commitment to inclusive teamwork.
