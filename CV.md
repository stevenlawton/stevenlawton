# Steven Lawton – CV / Resume

## Summary

I’m a seasoned Software Developer with a strong technical background across backend systems, infrastructure, and full-stack product delivery.

- Built real-time payment systems, developer platforms, API onboarding workflows, and ML pipelines for medieval manuscripts
- Delivered systems across fintech, retail, Web3, and publishing – with highly transferable experience
- Recent focus: GoLang microservices, Kubernetes, internal tooling, CI/CD, and platform automation
- Regular contributor to open-source projects and long-term maintainer of personal backend tools and services
- Equally comfortable pair programming, working solo, or leading delivery in high-autonomy teams
- Strong communicator, hands-on builder, and pragmatic problem-solver

## Personal Statement
I’m an experienced Software Developer with a strong background in both hardware and software, combined with 
well-developed communication and organisational skills. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean, scalable 
engineering and thrive in environments that value autonomy, delivery, and technical curiosity.

In recent projects, I’ve worked extensively with Cryptocurrency systems (including Web3 and smart contracts) and Machine 
Learning for image recognition and classification — specifically on a digital library of medieval manuscripts. I also 
maintain several long-running personal tools and backend systems, many of which I’ve recently rebuilt in GoLang to 
modernise their architecture, improve performance, and sharpen my backend infrastructure skills.

I’m looking for a role where I can apply this broad experience to build robust systems, contribute meaningfully to a 
team, and continue learning in a high-impact environment.

## Skills
### Cloud-Native Backend Engineering
- **GoLang**, Java (Spring Boot), Node.js (TypeScript), Scala – used to build scalable microservices and API platforms in domains such as fintech, retail, and e-commerce.
- Deployed services to **AWS** (ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, IAM) and **Kubernetes** (EKS), managed via **Terraform** and **Helm**.
- Designed and implemented secure identity flows using **OAuth2**, **OIDC**, and tools like **Auth0** and **Keycloak**.

### DevOps, CI/CD & Platform Tooling
- Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, and internal PaaS systems.
- Containerised and orchestrated workloads using **Docker**, **Nomad**, and **Helm**, including service mesh integration (**Istio**) and API gateways (**Kong**).
- Applied secrets management, environment segregation, and delivery automation across dev, staging, and production environments.

### API Design, Messaging & Eventing
- Designed and governed APIs using **OpenAPI**, **AsyncAPI**, and best practices for versioning, compatibility, and mocking.
- Built event-driven architectures with **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, and cloud-native ingestion pipelines.
- Focused on resilience, structured logging, distributed tracing, and performance tuning in production systems.

### Databases & Observability
- Worked with **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **DynamoDB**, **Redis**, **InfluxDB**, and **TimescaleDB** across various use cases.
- Set up observability stacks using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Datadog**, and **Kibana**, with custom metrics and alerting.

### Web3 & Cryptographic Systems
- Developed and audited smart contracts in **Solidity** (Ethereum), implemented **Lightning Network** integrations, and contributed to open-source decentralised platforms.
- Familiar with crypto wallet infrastructure, decentralised identity flows, and ISO 20022-style messaging for regulated systems.

### Testing, Quality & Reliability
- Practised **TDD** and **Pair Programming** in production teams, with testing suites built using **JUnit**, **TestNG**, **Mockito**, and API tools like **Postman**.
- Delivered regression, integration, and performance test coverage within CI/CD pipelines.

### Developer Experience & Tooling
- Built internal tooling for developer onboarding, spec validation, and workflow automation using **GitHub Actions**, **SwaggerHub**, and platform-native SDKs.
- Fluent with **IntelliJ**, **VS Code**, **Vim**, **Makefiles**, and Linux-based dev environments.
- Advocated for clean DevEx and DX automation in high-velocity teams.

### Communication, Leadership & Delivery
- Led delivery of critical migrations, refactors, and platform rebuilds, often in lean or embedded teams.
- Skilled in technical planning, mentoring, and stakeholder communication across engineering, product, and ops.
- Volunteer **Beaver Scout Leader**, with strong people skills, group leadership experience, and commitment to inclusive teamwork.

---

**Transferability**:  
Experience gained in fintech, retail, and e-commerce is highly transferable to SaaS, infrastructure, Web3, public sector, and regulated industries. Comfortable working across domains where performance, security, and team agility are key.
