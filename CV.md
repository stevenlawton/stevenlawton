# Steven Lawton – CV / Resume

## Summary

I’m a seasoned Software Developer with a broad technical background spanning backend systems, infrastructure, and 
full-stack development. With experience across sectors including retail, fintech, Web3, and publishing, I’ve built 
everything from real-time payment systems and API onboarding platforms to machine learning pipelines for image 
recognition on medieval manuscripts.

My recent focus has been on GoLang microservices, Kubernetes deployments, and developer experience tooling — often 
working in high-autonomy roles where delivery and pragmatic problem-solving are key. I’ve contributed to open-source 
projects and frequently refactor or rebuild my own long-running personal tools as my skillset evolves.

Equally comfortable pair programming or leading delivery, I bring a mix of technical depth, delivery focus, and a long 
history of adapting to whatever a team or system needs. Outside of work, I volunteer as a Beaver Scout Leader, helping 
young people build life skills through adventure and teamwork.
