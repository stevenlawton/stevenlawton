<h1 id="steven-lawton-cv-resume">Steven Lawton – CV / Resume</h1>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’m a seasoned Software Developer with a strong technical background
across backend systems, infrastructure, and full-stack product
delivery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Built real-time payment systems, developer platforms, API onboarding
workflows, and ML pipelines for medieval manuscripts</li>
<li>Delivered systems across fintech, retail, Web3, and publishing –
with highly transferable experience</li>
<li>Recent focus: GoLang microservices, Kubernetes, internal tooling,
CI/CD, and platform automation</li>
<li>Regular contributor to open-source projects and long-term maintainer
of personal backend tools and services</li>
<li>Equally comfortable pair programming, working solo, or leading
delivery in high-autonomy teams</li>
<li>Strong communicator, hands-on builder, and pragmatic
problem-solver</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="personal-statement">Personal Statement</h2>
<p>I’m an experienced Software Developer with a strong background in
both hardware and software, combined with well-developed communication
and organisational skills. I enjoy solving real-world problems through
clean, scalable engineering and thrive in environments that value
autonomy, delivery, and technical curiosity.</p>
<p>In recent projects, I’ve worked extensively with Cryptocurrency
systems (including Web3 and smart contracts) and Machine Learning for
image recognition and classification — specifically on a digital library
of medieval manuscripts. I also maintain several long-running personal
tools and backend systems, many of which I’ve recently rebuilt in GoLang
to modernise their architecture, improve performance, and sharpen my
backend infrastructure skills.</p>
<p>I’m looking for a role where I can apply this broad experience to
build robust systems, contribute meaningfully to a team, and continue
learning in a high-impact environment.</p>
<h2 id="experience-overview">Experience Overview</h2>
<p>Over 20 years of professional software development, across roles
ranging from hands-on contributor to team lead, and industries including
fintech, retail, Web3, and publishing. I’ve delivered backend systems,
cloud-native infrastructure, and cross-platform tools in both startup
and enterprise environments.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Communication &amp; Collaboration</strong><br />
Skilled at working with engineers, product teams, business stakeholders,
and leadership. Equally comfortable pair programming, mentoring junior
developers, or leading cross-functional delivery efforts. Proven in
fully remote, hybrid, and co-located teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem-Solving &amp; Adaptability</strong><br />
Experienced in debugging legacy systems, designing clean architectures,
and migrating codebases under time or regulatory pressure. Able to
operate under uncertainty, pick up unfamiliar tech quickly, and make
pragmatic trade-offs to get things delivered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delivery &amp; Technical Ownership</strong><br />
Regularly lead the technical side of migrations, refactors, and
infrastructure overhauls. Known for delivering maintainable, observable
systems with clear boundaries and reusable patterns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Volunteering &amp; Community</strong><br />
Longstanding <strong>Beaver Scout Leader</strong>, helping young people
build resilience, teamwork, and life skills. This work reflects my
broader strengths in leadership, empathy, and building environments
where others can thrive.</p></li>

<h2 id="why-me">Why Me?</h2>
<p>I’m the person teams turn to when something’s complex, messy, or
stuck. Whether refactoring a legacy system, standing up a new platform,
or building internal tooling, I focus on leaving systems clearer, teams
faster, and outcomes stronger. Trusted to work independently or lead
delivery when it matters, I’ve built a career on pragmatism, depth, and
getting things shipped. Readers often conclude I’m a strong fit for
platform-oriented, backend-heavy roles where autonomy, clarity, and
consistent delivery matter.</p>
